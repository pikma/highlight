# Space Macro

Press space to highlight the word under the cursor. Or your selection, if you
have selected text.

Press <leader><space> to turn the highlighting off (until you press space
again).

You can customize the mapping by setting

```
let g:space_macro_on = '<space>'
let g:space_macro_off = '<leader><space>'
```
in your .vimrc.

See [the documentation](doc/space_macro.txt).
