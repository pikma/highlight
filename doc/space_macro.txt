1. Usage                                                  |space-macro-usage|
2. Customize mappings                                     |space-macro-mappings|

1. USAGE ~
                                                             *space-macro-usage*

In normal mode, press <space> (the space key) to highlight the word under
your cursor. It relies on vim's search feature, so you can jump to the next
occurence of the highlighted word using N, etc. Note that it will only match
other occurences of the same exact word. For example, highlighting 'foo'
wouldn't match 'foobar' (try it!).

In visual mode (when you are selecting text), press <space> to highglight your
selection. Note that in this case, it will match other occurences of your
selection even they are not a full word. For example, selecting 'foo' and then
highlighting it will match the 'foo' in 'foobar'.

2. CUSTOMIZE MAPPINGS ~

You can customize mappings by adding and customizing the following lines in
your .vimrc file:

>
  " The key combination that enables highlighting.
  let g:space_macro_on = '<space>'

  " The key combination that disables highlighting.
  let g:space_macro_off = '<leader><space>'
<

Leaving one of those variables empty will disable the keybinding.
